      In the battle of Kurukshetra, Arjun’s conscience was haunted by the
      thoughts of killing his own kith and kin, ancestors and gurus. He refused
      to fight, and then Krishna delivered the philosophical epic called
      Bhagavad Gita. He said, “I am the sole creator of this universe. If, I
      wish, I can kill the enemies in a moment with ‘Sudarshan Chakra’. But I
      want to teach the importance of Karma (performing own duty) to coming
      generation.” He further added,” Do your duty and be detached from its
      outcome, do not get driven by the result, enjoy the journey of reaching
      there.” In the end, he convinced Arujna to fight and destroy the enemies.
